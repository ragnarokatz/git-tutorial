    "Git was started by the same guy who started Linux kernel. But of course, as both software are open source, there have been many developers who contributed their work over the years. However, as the guy who started it, Linus Torvald, has always been the main driving force behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux kernel, the basis of the many distributions of Linux platforms that we have today, is an incredibly complex project. And it was using a paid version control system at the time. However, as that particular version control up'ed its price and the project was growing too big for it to handle, Linus cut the ties and started looking for alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, he couldn't find anything on the market that suits his needs. He needed three things. Distributed developments, supports many developers at a time. Scale, needs to be able to handle large amount of code, many different versions. Speed, it needs to be able to do its job fast. And low cost, preferably free.\n",
    "\n",
    "As he was looking for the tool, the linux community can't wait. There's ongoing development, and the code base has grown to such a size, and there have been so many different versions coming from so many different developers. He could no longer handle it with the current set of tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "So he stopped. he stopped the development of the project and said, we can no longer continue this project until a capable tool is found. Or made. So that's how git came to life.\n",
    "\n",
    "what it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "so what is git? in simple terms, if you take away all the fluff, it is a tree of commits in order. It's tree, not a list, since it supports branching. \n",
    "(shows picture)\n",
    "So you understand the term tree, you understand what i mean by in sequence, so order matters.\n",
    "next question is, what is a commit?\n",
    "\n",
    "what is a commit?\n",
    "\n",
    "A commit is a collection of changes. And there are four types of changes that can be included in any commit. Adding a file, removing a file, renaming a file, and modifying a file. inside a file change, added lines are denoted by ++, deleted lines are denoted by --. this is the standard notation for diff.\n",
    "\n",
    "comparison between git and clearcase:\n",
    "clear case is the legacy software we use here at ibm, developered by us, rational clearcase.\n",
    "The biggest difference is that git is offline. Yes. offline. Your repo on your local drive, it is considered a complete package, a complete product. Yes, if you reformat your computer, you're gonna lose everything. Hence why people sync their repos to the cloud services. But, as it stands, even without the remote point, you have access to all the version control functions in your local repo on your local computer. This is one of the biggest differences between git and clearcase.\n",
    "\n",
    "let me show you what I mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "(demonstrations)\n",
    "mkdir sample-local\n",
    "cd sample-local\n",
    "git init\n",
    "touch sample_file\n",
    "(edit the file)\n",
    "git status\n",
    "git add *\n",
    "\n",
    "(shows picture)\n",
    "I need to explain a little bit about the three regions available to the user in a git version control system. First of all, there are commits. Which are changes that have already been recorded to the commit history. Then there's the staging area and the untracked area, these are sort of your workspace. In order to commit a change or a file, that particular change or file needs to be put into the staging area first. And when you do commit, any files or changes leftover in the untracked area remains untouched. so `git add` puts the file into the staging area. In order to put it back, it tells you what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "git commit -m \"initial commit\"\n",
    "git log\n",
    "\n",
    "so now we can see that the change has been indeed recorded in history.\n",
    "\n",
    "(edit the file)\n",
    "git diff\n",
    "git add *\n",
    "git commit -m \"modify the sample_file\"\n",
    "\n",
    "here's what i mean, it's already a complete version control software. You can already go back to previous version.\n",
    "\n",
    "git log\n",
    "git status\n",
    "git checkout (sha of first commit)\n",
    "\n",
    "(shows first version of the file)\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that without any remote, the local repo is a complete version control system standalone on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "now, I'm gonna show you how the version control system syncs with each other over the internet. except I'm gonna replicate all the action locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "mkdir sample-remote\n",
    "cd sample-remote\n",
    "git init --bare\n",
    "\n",
    "this is how you initialize a remote repo, I can show you how the folder structure is different between a local and a remote repo.\n",
    "(shows folder structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "now we are going to link it. link the remote repo to the local repo.\n",
    "cd sample-local\n",
    "git push\n",
    "(explains no remote found currently)\n",
    "git remote add origin (path to sample-remote)\n",
    "(shows the added remote in config file)\n",
    "git push\n",
    "(explains the remote has no such branch yet, so the first time we need to use)\n",
    "git push --set-upstream origin master\n",
    "\n",
    "to prove to you that this actually works, we're gonna do a git clone of the remote repo, just like how you clone repo from the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "So i'm gonna clone the remote and give it a different name, lets say sample-local2.\n",
    "git clone (path to sample-remote) sample-local2\n",
    "cd sample-local2\n",
    "(show the file)\n",
    "\n",
    "(shows picture)\n",
    "So this is the resulting relationship. We've got one remote that is being read by two different local repos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's complicate things up a little bit. I'm gonna create another remote.\n",
    "mkdir sample-remote2\n",
    "cd sample-remote2\n",
    "git init --bare\n",
    "\n",
    "and we're going to link this remote to the first local, which we have created earlier. We're gonna give it a different name, say origin2.\n",
    "cd sample-local\n",
    "git remote add origin2 (path to sample-remote2)\n",
    "\n",
    "git push\n",
    "(shows everything up-to-date, but not really).\n",
    "\n",
    "So what git push is, is that git push is actually a shorthand of the full command. When you write git push, git automatically fills in the required parameters with default values, and the default values are: origin for the remote, and master for the branch. so when you just do git push, what it actually does is git push origin master.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, since we just added a new remote and called it origin2, we need to manually change the default parameters in order to push it to the new remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "git push origin2 master\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we have something like this.\n",
    "(shows picture)\n",
    "only sample-local knows about sample-remote2, sample-local2 does not know the existence of sample-remote2.\n",
    "\n",
    "now we're gonna add a little twist to this. I'm gonna make another change to the repo, and I'm only gonna push it to the original remote, not the remote I just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "cd sample-local\n",
    "touch sample_file2\n",
    "git add *\n",
    "git commit -m \"\n",
    "git push origin master\n",
    "\n",
    "and then I'm gonna clone from the second remote, to create a third local repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "git clone (path to sample-remote2) sample-local3\n",
    "\n",
    "now we have something like this.\n",
    "(shows picture)\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we have a problem, where if I don't push the latest change to the second remote sample-remote2, and given that the third local repo does not know the existence of the first remote sample-remote, it's never going to updated with the latest change.\n",
    "\n",
    "the first cloned repo, sample-local2, which points to the first origin, will get the change if pulled. Let me demonstrate:\n",
    "cd sample-local2\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "(shows file sample_file2)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the second cloned repo, sample-remote2, will never get that file.\n",
    "cd sample-local3\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "(shows directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "So this example demonstrates the problem with distributed nature of git. So have this picture in mind, now expand it to a thousand developers with multiple repo hostings, say bitbucket, github.ibm.com, github.com, bitbucket.igm.org, gitlab, etc. Problem number one, obviously not everything is in sync. The second problem is there is no single source of truth. So unlike clearcase, which you know, is centralized, the code being hosted on the clearcase server is the one and only source of truth, we need to designate our own. So for example, for db2, we designate the db2 repo underneath the db2 organization to the single source of truth. It's not my fork, not your fork, not anybody's local version on their laptop, it is the one under db2 repo, hosted on github.ibm.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any questions?"

    "\n",
    "This is what a branch is in practise, in git. The concept of a branch in git is a little different however. Right now, I need to make sure that we all have the same definition of what a branch is in git.\n",
    "\n",
    "(shows picture)\n",
    "this is not a branch. This is twig, this is a stick, which means absolutely nothing in git.\n",
    "(shows picture)\n",
    "and this is not a branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a branch? a branch is defined as from beginning of commit history until the last commit on your path.\n",
    "so these are branches, complete from start to finish. This is the master branch, this is the new-branch branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a different example, so while I'm working on this new-branch, some other developer has submitted code and updated master. So there has been ongoing development done to master branch while I'm still working on my branch. So in this case, these are the branches, and the nodes highlighted in red are the commits common to both branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept must be mastered before we can talk about merging."
